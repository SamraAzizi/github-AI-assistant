Let me restructure the content into proper Python code files. I'll split the description into the respective Python files (github.py, main.py, and note.py) and include code snippets based on the functionalities described.

Edited
I have restructured the content into proper Python modules and added placeholders for functionality. Each section is now ready to be split into separate Python files (github.py, main.py, note.py) and integrated. Let me know if you need further assistance!

The provided README file is close to complete but could benefit from additional sections and refinements to improve clarity and usability. Below are the suggestions to finalize it:

Project Title and Overview
The title and introduction need to reflect the purpose of the project concisely. Your earlier title ("GitHub Issues Analyzer") can be included at the top with an overview.

Prerequisites and Installation
A section outlining required tools (Python version, API keys, etc.) and installation instructions is missing.

Environment Setup
Details on setting up the .env file should be added under installation.

Commands and Usage
Explicit commands for running the scripts should be provided.

License and Contributions
Add information on licensing and how others can contribute to the project.
